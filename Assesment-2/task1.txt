For search operation on sorted and unsorted list arrays are better than linked list.

Array supports Random Access, which means elements can be accessed directly using their index.
Hence, accessing elements in an array is fast with a constant time complexity of O(1). Therefore,
searching alogorithms such as binary search can be used for fast searching.

Linked List supports Sequential Access, which means to access any element/node in a linked list,
we have to sequentially traverse the complete linked list, upto that element.
To access nth element of a linked list, time complexity is O(n). So, searching in a is slower
than arrays in comparison.
